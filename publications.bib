  abstract  = {Investigating strategies that are able to efficiently deal with multi-label classification tasks is a current research topic in machine learning. Many methods have been proposed, making the selection of the most suitable strategy a challenging issue. From this premise, this paper presents an extensive empirical analysis of the binary transformation strategies and base algorithms for multi-label learning. This subset of strategies uses the one-versus-all approach to transform the original data, generating one binary data set per label, upon which any binary base algorithm can be applied. Considering that the influence of the base algorithm on the predictive performance obtained by the strategies has not been considered in depth by many empirical studies, we investigated the influence of distinct base algorithms on the performance of several strategies. Thus, this study covers a family of multi-label strategies using a diversified range of base algorithms, exploring their relationship over different perspectives. This finding has significant implications concerning the methodology of evaluation adopted in multi-label experiments containing binary transformation strategies, given that multiple base algorithms should be considered. Despite these improvements in strategy and base algorithms, for many data sets, a large number of labels, mainly those less frequent, were either never predicted, or always misclassified. We conclude the experimental analysis by recommending strategies and base algorithms in accordance with different performance criteria.},

In this work, we analyze the noisy importance sampling (IS), i.e., IS working with noisy evaluations of the target density. We present the general framework and derive optimal proposal densities for noisy IS estimators. The optimal proposals incorporate the information of the variance of the noisy realizations, proposing points in regions where the noise power is higher. We also compare the use of the optimal proposals with previous optimality approaches considered in a noisy IS framework.}
