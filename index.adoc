== Bio

Since December 2013 I am a research scientist in the link:http://www.hiit.fi/pm[Parsimonious Modelling Group], affiliated with http://ics.aalto.fi/en/[Aalto University] and the http://www.hiit.fi/[Helsinki Institute for Information Technology] in Finland.

Prior to that I was a post-doc, and then lecturer, in the http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/[Department of Signal Theory and Communications at the Universidad Carlos III, Madrid]. 

I completed my PhD in the http://cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/[Machine Learning Group at the University of Waikato] in 2010. 
//Earlier I did my BCMS(Hons.) at Waikato.

//My main research interests are in the field of machine learning, particularly

//	* multi-label / multi-output classification
//	* scalable methods
//	* learning from sequential data 
//	* classification in evolving data streams
//   * wireless sensor networks and sensory data
//	* graphical models
//	* neural networks
