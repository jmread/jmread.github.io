<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>My main research interests are in the area of <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>data science</strong>, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>, <strong>IoT</strong> and <strong>sensor analytics</strong>, and sequential data such as <strong>time series</strong> and <strong>data-stream mining</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_multi_label_classification">Multi-label Classification</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In <strong>multi-label classification</strong>, values for multiple target variables are predicted for each instance, as opposed to the traditional supervised learning problem where a single target variable (class) is associated with each instance. The main challenge is detecting and modelling dependencies among labels, while maintaining scalibility to large problems. This task is relevant to many domains where multiple labels can be assigned to text documents, images, video and other media, and are also involved in many medical and biological applications.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Over the time, multi-label methods have become increasingly scalable. This leads to a broader set of applications, including predicting through space and time. It is a particular type of <strong>structured output prediction</strong> and can be applied to such topics, such as sequence prediction and forecasting, localization and segmentation. There exist many connections with other topics, namely <strong>probabilistic graphical models</strong>, <strong>neural networks</strong>, <strong>time series forecasting</strong>, sequence <strong>segmentation</strong> and mining, and dynamical models.</p></div>

<h3 id="_data_stream_classification">Data Stream Classification</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Many real-world applications are found in the context of <em>data streams</em>, where data instances arrive continuously in a theoretically-infinite stream, for example in sensor networks, online social media, news feeds, and large deployments of e-mail.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When temporal dependence is present (rather than an i.i.d. stream), we may consider this a time series, but with additional important challenges.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For example, methods must be able to process large volumes of data quickly
and learn and make predictions in real time, as well as detect and adapt
to <em>concept drift</em>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_applications">Applications</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I have been interested in many applications involving real-world data and deployments, often dealing with sensory-data.</p></div>

<h4 id="_learning_to_predict_a_traveller_8217_s_route_and_destination">Learning to predict a traveller&#8217;s route and destination</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Given only a week or so of location data from a mobile phone device, it was possible to make reasonably accurate predictions about the a traveller&#8217;s route and future destination in an urban setting. See, for example,

this <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-MBtJlIZA-BWkVVYkJETEtZckk">Demo Animation</a> (the captions explain what is going on)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;using real data collecting in the greater Helsinki area.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tracking_on_very_low_power_sensor_motes">Tracking on very low-power sensor motes</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I worked on formulating and implementing a distributed particle filter on very low-power motes (4 MHz CPU) for real-time target tracking. For example, see this  more information, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-MBtJlIZA-BcU1sZXpaNlV3a3M/view?usp=sharing">this video of a demo of testbed deployment</a> for tracking using only light sensor observations.</p></div>

<h4 id="_modelling_tree_growth_in_scots_pine">Modelling tree growth in Scots pine</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I worked with forestry scientists to model intra-annual growth of Scots pine trees in Finand and France using time series and machine learning models.</p></div>
