== Software

=== MEKA: A Multi-label/multi-target Extension to weKA

I am the creator and main developer of the link:http://meka.sourceforge.net[MEKA Project] for multi-label classification:
//image::GUI04.png["MEKA", height=100, width=100, link="GUI04.png"]
A Java framework containing around two dozen multi-label and multi-output classifiers for train/test, cross validation, incremental and semi-supervised learning.

=== Molearn: A Multi-label/multi-target framework in Python

I started the link:https://github.com/jmread/molearn[Molearn] Project, which provides a Python implementation of some of the classifiers included in MEKA, using +numpy+ and +sklearn+.

=== MOA: Massive Online Analysis

I am involved in the link:http://moa.cs.waikato.ac.nz[MOA Project] for learning in data streams.

=== A2RMS: Implementation of the A2RMS Sampling Algorithm

I (with Luca Martino and David Luengo) maintain Matlab/GNU Octave link:http://a2rms.sourceforge.net/[code for the A2RMS sampling algorithm].

=== DPFlib: A library in `C` for distributed particle filters.

I developed link:http://sourceforge.net/projects/dpflib/[code for implementing distributed particle filters] on very low powered sensor 'motes', in the `TinyOS` operating system. However, the code is also standalone and can be compiled and run by regular `C`. Here is a link:videos/COMONSENS3.m4v[video of a deployment].

== Datasets

Datasets which I have created (or parsed into a new format) are available at link:http://meka.sourceforge.net/#datasets[]; some of which are now also available from the link:http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html[mulan website].
