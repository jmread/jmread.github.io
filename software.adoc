=== Scikit-Multiflow: A Multi-label/multi-ouput framework for streaming data in Python

link:https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/[Scikit-Multiflow] provides a Python framework for comparing, evaluating, and visualizing machine learning methods in a data-stream setting. Many methods from MEKA are reimplemented here (earlier, as part of the link:https://github.com/jmread/molearn[Molearn] project). The Scikit-Learn framework supplies the `base models'.

=== MEKA: A Multi-label/multi-target Extension to weKA

I created the link:http://meka.sourceforge.net[MEKA Project] for multi-label classification:

//image::GUI04.png["MEKA", height=100, width=100, link="GUI04.png"]
A Java framework containing around two dozen multi-label and multi-output classifiers for train/test, cross validation, incremental and semi-supervised learning.

=== MOA: Massive Online Analysis

I am involved in the link:http://moa.cs.waikato.ac.nz[MOA Project] for learning in data streams.

=== ALife: Artificial Life environment

I created link:https://github.com/jmread/alife[ALife]: an artificial life environment for testing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms with continous action and state space. 

=== A2RMS: Implementation of the A2RMS Sampling Algorithm

link:http://a2rms.sourceforge.net/[A2RMS] is a Matlab/GNU Octave implementation of the A2RMS sampling algorithm.

=== DPFlib: A library in `C` for distributed particle filters.

This is link:http://sourceforge.net/projects/dpflib/[code for implementing distributed particle filters] on very low powered sensor 'motes', in the `TinyOS` operating system. However, the code is also standalone and can be compiled and run by regular `C`. Here is a link:videos/COMONSENS3.m4v[video of a deployment] with a sensor testbed.

== Datasets

Datasets which I have created (or parsed into a new format) are available at link:http://meka.sourceforge.net/#datasets[]; some of which are now also available from the link:http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html[mulan website].
